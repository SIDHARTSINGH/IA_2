      "Ecological Niche Models Reveal Climate Change Effect on Biogeographical Regions: The Iberian Peninsula as a Case Study",
    abstract:
      "How species are distributed on Earth depends largely on climate factors. Whenever these environmental conditions change, species tend to shift their distributions to reach more favourable conditions. Distinct sets of species similarly distributed (i.e., chorotypes) occur in biogeographical regions with homogeneous environmental conditions. Here, we analysed whether biogeographical regions are unstable over time (from the past to the future). We modelled the realised niche of amphibians and reptiles in the Iberian Peninsula in the present, and several past and future climate scenarios. Then, we used Jaccard’s index and the unweighted pair group method (UPGMA) to define the biogeographical regions. Our results suggest that the biogeographical regions of Iberian amphibians and reptiles changed greatly over time, due to the climatic changes between periods. Biogeographical regions composed of species with Atlantic affinities changed particularly, overall gaining suitable areas in past colder periods and losing suitable areas in warmer periods. The areas of refugia for amphibians over time corresponded to the most humid regions (north-west of the peninsula), while the most important areas for reptiles occur in the south and on the Atlantic coast. The identification of biogeographical patterns considering past climate changes is essential to better apply conservation measures.",

    title: "Review on climate change and its effect on wildlife and ecosystem",
    abstract:
      "Long-term variations in the abiotic factors such as temperature, rainfall, snow, and wind pattern are referred to as climatic changes (IPCC 2007a). Climate changes create new challenges for humans and wildlife, most common are cloudbursts, dry spells, increasing sea level, thawing permafrost, salinization, increased wildfi res, reduced agricultural yields, water diminish, health problems due to high temperature in cities, and ablation (WWF). Climate change affects individual species and their habitat which alter the structure and function of the ecosystem and services that the natural system provided to society (Diazz, et al. 2019) Most often the climate change is limited but sometimes it spreads commonly and causes the disturbance in food chains, nutrient fl ow, and atmospheric circulation in other regions. Solar energy plays important role in all biological activities. It sustains most of the biomass and supports primary production. It keeps the earth's biological tolerable level. In discussing the effect of climate changes on wildlife it is noted that some species have not been much affected by these changes, while some others go to distinct. In tropical regions, there is great biodiversity because of two main phenomena: phylogenetic niche conservatism and ecological productivity. These two factors play signifi cant roles but accumulating theoretical and experimental studies recommend that the single most important factor is kinetics: the temperature dependency of ecological and evolutionary rates. The relatively high temperatures in the tropics generate and sustain high diversity because ‘the Red Queen runs faster when she is hot’ [1].",

      "Climate change penalty and benefit on surface ozone: a global perspective based on CMIP6 earth system models",
    abstract:
      "This work presents an analysis of the effect of climate change on surface ozone discussing the related penalties and benefits around the globe from the global modelling perspective based on simulations with five CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) Earth System Models. As part of AerChemMIP (Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project) all models conducted simulation experiments considering future climate (ssp370SST) and present-day climate (ssp370pdSST) under the same future emissions trajectory (SSP3-7.0). A multi-model global average climate change benefit on surface ozone of −0.96 ± 0.07 ppbv °C−1 is calculated which is mainly linked to the dominating role of enhanced ozone destruction with higher water vapour abundances under a warmer climate. Over regions remote from pollution sources, there is a robust decline in mean surface ozone concentration on an annual basis as well as for boreal winter and summer varying spatially from −0.2 to −2 ppbv °C−1, with strongest decline over tropical oceanic regions. The implication is that over regions remote from pollution sources (except over the Arctic) there is a consistent climate change benefit for baseline ozone due to global warming. However, ozone increases over regions close to anthropogenic pollution sources or close to enhanced natural biogenic volatile organic compounds emission sources with a rate ranging regionally from 0.2 to 2 ppbv C−1, implying a regional surface ozone penalty due to global warming. Overall, the future climate change enhances the efficiency of precursor emissions to generate surface ozone in polluted regions and thus the magnitude of this effect depends on the regional emission changes considered in this study within the SSP3_7.0 scenario. The comparison of the climate change impact effect on surface ozone versus the combined effect of climate and emission changes indicates the dominant role of precursor emission changes in projecting surface ozone concentrations under future climate change scenarios.",

    abstract:
      "Human-induced climate change is causing unpredictable changes around the world to global economies and people’s way of living. We present a study undertaken on the prediction of three parameters that quantify climatic change, namely Land Surface Temperature, Carbon Monoxide, and Precipitation. Since the three parameters are essentially non stationary in nature, the differencing method has been looked at to fine-tune the output of the prediction models. The two seasonal autoregressive models chosen for the study are Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and TBATS, due to non-stationarity of the data. The focus is to predict climate change using predictive models for Indian sub-continent. Region-wise dataset was extracted from Google earth engine using a reducer function. A comparison of the forecasting models using root mean square error and mean absolute scaled error suggests that SARIMA performs better in the case of Land Surface Temperature and Precipitation whereas TBATS performs better for Carbon Monoxide Concentration.",

    abstract:
      "Climate change is now the biggest concern in the Arctic and is causing unpredictable changes to the sea ice, making the life of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) more difficult. Although polar bears respond and adapt to all the changes in the environment actively and quickly, climate change still brings them some negative impacts. Historically, the earth has experienced many eras when the climate goes up and down. However, rising in temperature has been happening at a marked rate, 0.32°F per decade, while 2021 ranks as the sixth-warmest year. The consequences of global warming led to an earlier winter break-up and ice melting; those cause polar bears to lose their habitats and have less praying time. The populations of seals, which are their primary food resource, are also affected by the unusual climate. As a result, some of the polar bears are forced to turn their target from the ice into the shores and even human territories. The loss of ice also led to a further distance between pieces of ice, which forced polar bears to swim for a longer distance for migrating. Moreover, without enough energy being stored, pregnancy then becomes a hard task for female polar bears. Therefore, the size of litter has been declined while the health conditions of adult polar bears also went down. Although actions have been taken both nationally and internationally to prevent polar bears from going extinct and stop climate change, little achievement was made.",

This difference, which is due mainly to absorption and downward emission of radiant energy by atmospheric trace gases, results in global mean surface temperature about 32 K greater than what it would otherwise be for the same planetary absorption of solar radiation, and is thus of enormous importance to Earth's climate. This Resource Letter introduces the physics of the greenhouse effect and more broadly of Earth's climate system and provides resources for further study. A companion Resource Letter (GECC-2), planned for the following issue, examines the increase in the greenhouse effect due to human activities over the past 200 years and its consequences for Earth's climate system.",

      "Estimated effect of the permafrost carbon feedback on the zero emissions commitment to climate change",
    abstract:
      "Abstract. Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC), the expected change in global temperature following the cessation of CO2 emissions has recently been assessed by the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP). ZECMIP concluded that the component of ZEC from CO2 emissions will likely be close to zero in the decades following the cessation of emissions. However, of the 18 Earth system models that participated in ZECMIP only two included a representation of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate change. To better assess the potential impact of permafrost carbon decay on ZEC a series of perturbed parameter experiments are here conducted with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity. The experiment suggest that the permafrost carbon cycle feedback will directly add 0.06 [0.02 to 0.14] °C to the benchmark ZEC value assesses 50 years after 1000 PgC of CO2 has been emitted to the atmosphere. An additional 0.04 [0 to 0.06] °C is likely to been added relative to the benchmark ZEC value from the thaw-lag effect unaccounted for in the ZECMIP experiment design. Overall we assess that the permafrost carbon feedback is unlikely to change the assessment that ZEC is close to zero on decadal timescales, however the feedback is expected to become more important over the coming centuries.\n",

      "Examining Students’ Thoughts on Climate Change in the Context of Basic Concept",
    abstract:
      'In this study, our aim was to investigate the beliefs of middle school students about climate change. We conducted study with 183 secondary school students. Within the scope of the study, students were asked two questions about climate change, and written responses were analyzed using an embedded a mixed-method approach. The questions posed were: (1) What is the cause of global warming? (2) What factors influence the climate? Based on the results of the quantitative analysis of the participants\' responses, the answers to the first question were "human," "greenhouse effect," and "Earth." The concepts of "pollution," "atmosphere," and "Earth" are used in the second question. As per the qualitative analysis results, the students\' responses focused on three elements: "living things, Earth, and atmosphere." The students responses to the second question reveal a more specific or general attitude. The findings indicate that students view climate change not merely as an isolated phenomenon but as a complex system influenced by various components. It is also suggested that students have an understanding of the distinction between weather and climate. The ability to connect climate change with social issues may encourage individuals to make greater efforts in mitigating its effects.',

    abstract:
      "The changing climate and the rapid urbanisation may alter flood severity and influence the decision‐making process for flood management. In this study, a Multi‐Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework for optimal decision‐making in flood protection is developed and applied to a central flood‐prone basin of Jakarta, Indonesia. Specifically, the decisions are on levees corresponding to protection under different rainfall return periods (RP), considering climate change and associated uncertainties, urbanisation, and evolving socio‐economic features of the flood plain. Three cases were studied to analyse future (year 2050) conditions (i) future rainfall/current urban, (ii) current rainfall/future urban and (iii) future rainfall/future urban. Future climate change projections from the NASA Earth Exchange are used to obtain information about changes in rainfall, whereas Landsat derived imperviousness maps along with the population projections are used for future urban conditions. Annual Expected Loss, Graduality, upgrade Construction cost and Net‐Socio‐Economic Vulnerability Index are the criteria used in the MCDA. It is found that climate change has a higher impact compared to urbanisation on the flood protection decisions. For the basin studied, the extreme future case of increased rainfall and urbanised conditions have the optimal decision in levee protection level corresponding to 250 years RP under current rainfall which corresponds to ~60 years RP under future rainfall.",

    title: "Impact of climate change by 2030 - indian perspective",
    abstract:
      "This paper aims to establish the effect of Green House Gases (GHGs) emissions on climate change. Greenhouse gas molecules formed due to anthropogenic activities absorb infrared radiations from the sun, and these molecules re-emit the radiations in all directions, causing temperature rise of the Earth's surface. Due to anthropogenic activities in the country, GHG emissions of GHGs are increasing. The motor vehicles running in the Indian cities with the fossil fuels like gasoline, diesel, etc., are emitting Carbon-di-oxide (CO2), Hydrocarbon (HCs), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and water vapor as greenhouse gases in the form of vehicular exhausts. These emissions are responsible for deteriorating ambient air quality of the cities like Delhi, National Capital Region (NCR), Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, etc. This paper outlines the necessary technologies and practices to mitigate GHG emissions of GHGs. The paper also discusses some of the strategies for reducing emissions of GHGs to minimize the effect of global warming and climate change. The impacts of implementing energy efficiency and conservation measures, the role of renewable energy, and hydrogen blends in the vehicular fuel Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) are also described in this paper. The emission performance of a passenger car suitable for bi-fuel combustion with 18 Hydrogen Compressed Natural Gas (18HCNG) has been compared with neat CNG fuel. The economic analysis with these two vehicular fuels in respect of reducing CO2 and NOx being greenhouse gases, has also been discussed in this paper.",

      "Geoinformation Technologies in Support of Environmental Hazards Monitoring under Climate Change: An Extensive Review",
    abstract:
      "Human activities and climate change constitute the contemporary catalyst for natural processes and their impacts, i.e., geo-environmental hazards. Globally, natural catastrophic phenomena and hazards, such as drought, soil erosion, quantitative and qualitative degradation of groundwater, frost, flooding, sea level rise, etc., are intensified by anthropogenic factors. Thus, they present rapid increase in intensity, frequency of occurrence, spatial density, and significant spread of the areas of occurrence. The impact of these phenomena is devastating to human life and to global economies, private holdings, infrastructure, etc., while in a wider context it has a very negative effect on the social, environmental, and economic status of the affected region. Geospatial technologies including Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing—Earth Observation as well as related spatial data analysis tools, models, databases, contribute nowadays significantly in predicting, preventing, researching, addressing, rehabilitating, and managing these phenomena and their effects. This review attempts to mark the most devastating geo-hazards from the view of environmental monitoring, covering the state of the art in the use of geospatial technologies in that respect. It also defines the main challenge of this new era which is nothing more than the fictitious exploitation of the information produced by the environmental monitoring so that the necessary policies are taken in the direction of a sustainable future. The review highlights the potential and increasing added value of geographic information as a means to support environmental monitoring in the face of climate change. The growth in geographic information seems to be rapidly accelerated due to the technological and scientific developments that will continue with exponential progress in the years to come. Nonetheless, as it is also highlighted in this review continuous monitoring of the environment is subject to an interdisciplinary approach and contains an amount of actions that cover both the development of natural phenomena and their catastrophic effects mostly due to climate change.",

      "Effect of Global Climate Change on Land Surface Temperature over Dubai, United Arab Emirates with the Aid of Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery",
    abstract:
      "Global Atmospheric Analysis is based upon varies remote sensing techniques. One of the key factors for this kind of survey is Land Surface Temperature (LST). LST surveys are utilized for the development of predicted climate models, urban covered land-atmosphere, supervising vegetation and monitoring Global Warming. It gives us the data ranging from spatial to temporal variation for the land. Along with LST; Land Surface Emissivity is also a vital factor in surveys related to earth surface characteristics. These values are required to utilize in the method applied to this survey. Extensive possibilities for surveying the surface through remote sensing is provided by the LANDSAT series. The analysis of this survey is based upon the images taken of Dubai and it is achieved by utilizing Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIS) and Operation Line Imager (OLI) satellite sensor records. Thermal band images obtained from LANDSAT 8 are processed in QGIS software by using band 10 data.",

      "Largest Rises of Swedish Treelines, Consistent with Climate Change Since the Early-20th Century",
    abstract:
      "Treeline advance during the past 100 years was assessed by repeat in situ measurement at 14 locations distributed along the entire Swedish Scandes, c. 800 km from south to north. Concerned species were mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). Treeline was narrowly defined as the highest elevation with trees, at least 2 m tall. In order to elucidate the full effect and power of climate change on the treeline area, focus is on sites with the most extensive treeline shifts, according to prior regional surveys. Thereby, local constraints (topoclimate) were minimized. Betula. Picea and Sorbus accomplished treeline rise predominantly by phenotypic height growth increment of old-established krummholz, while Pinus responded by establishment and growth of new specimens. The largest upshifts, irrespective of species, were in the order of 200 m (max. 245 m). In perspective of historical treeline shifts, the new and higher treelines are close to the position prevailing about 7000 years ago. In contrast to previous generalizations, no obvious differences existed between southern and northern Scandes. Based on a common temperature lapse rate of 0.6°C per 100 m altitude and recorded regional and centennial summer warming of 1.7°C, the observed rise appears as a fully expected response. This kind of performance indicates that, at optimal sites, treelines are in equilibrium with climate at a centennial scale, in cases of climate warming.",

      "Iterative model predictions for wildlife populations impacted by rapid climate change",
    abstract:
      "To improve understanding and management of the consequences of current rapid environmental change, ecologists advocate using long‐term monitoring data series to generate iterative near‐term predictions of ecosystem responses. This approach allows scientific evidence to increase rapidly and management strategies to be tailored simultaneously. Iterative near‐term forecasting may therefore be particularly useful for adaptive monitoring of ecosystems subjected to rapid climate change. Here, we show how to implement near‐term forecasting in the case of a harvested population of rock ptarmigan in high‐arctic Svalbard, a region subjected to the largest and most rapid climate change on Earth. We fitted state‐space models to ptarmigan counts from point transect distance sampling during 2005–2019 and developed two types of predictions: (1) explanatory predictions to quantify the effect of potential drivers of ptarmigan population dynamics, and (2) anticipatory predictions to assess the ability of candidate models of increasing complexity to forecast next‐year population density. Based on the explanatory predictions, we found that a recent increasing trend in the Svalbard rock ptarmigan population can be attributed to major changes in winter climate. Currently, a strong positive effect of increasing average winter temperature on ptarmigan population growth outweighs the negative impacts of other manifestations of climate change such as rain‐on‐snow events. Moreover, the ptarmigan population may compensate for current harvest levels. Based on the anticipatory predictions, the near‐term forecasting ability of the models improved nonlinearly with the length of the time series, but yielded good forecasts even based on a short time series. The inclusion of ecological predictors improved forecasts of sharp changes in next‐year population density, demonstrating the value of ecosystem‐based monitoring. Overall, our study illustrates the power of integrating near‐term forecasting in monitoring systems to aid understanding and management of wildlife populations exposed to rapid climate change. We provide recommendations for how to improve this approach.",

    abstract:
      "Abstract. Being an extensively produced natural fiber on earth, cotton is of importance for economies. Although the plant is broadly adapted to varying environments, the growth of and irrigation water demand on cotton may be challenged by future climate change.\nTo study the impacts of climate change on cotton productivity in different regions across the world and the irrigation water requirements related to it, we use the process-based, spatially detailed biosphere and hydrology model LPJmL (Lund–Potsdam–Jena managed land).\nWe find our modeled cotton yield levels in good agreement with reported values and simulated water consumption of cotton production similar to published estimates.\nFollowing the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) protocol, we employ an ensemble of five general circulation models under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the 2011–2099 period to simulate future cotton yields.\nWe find that irrigated cotton production does not suffer from climate change if CO2 effects are considered, whereas rainfed production is more sensitive to varying climate conditions.\nConsidering the overall effect of a changing climate and CO2 fertilization, cotton production on current cropland steadily increases for most of the RCPs. Starting from ∼65 million tonnes in 2010, cotton production for RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 equates to 83 and 92 million tonnes at the end of the century, respectively. Under RCP8.5, simulated global cotton production rises by more than 50 % by 2099.\nTaking only climate change into account, projected cotton production considerably shrinks in most scenarios, by up to one-third or 43 million tonnes under RCP8.5.\nThe simulation of future virtual water content (VWC) of cotton grown under elevated CO2 results for all scenarios in less VWC compared to ambient CO2 conditions.\nUnder RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, VWC is notably decreased by more than 2000 m3 t−1 in areas where cotton is produced under purely rainfed conditions. By 2040, the average global VWC for cotton declines in all scenarios from currently 3300 to 3000 m3 t−1, and reduction continues by up to 30 % in 2100 under RCP8.5.\nWhile the VWC decreases by the CO2 effect, elevated temperature acts in the opposite direction. Ignoring beneficial CO2 effects, global VWC of cotton would increase for all RCPs except RCP2.6, reaching more than 5000 m3 t−1 by the end of the simulation period under RCP8.5.\nGiven the economic relevance of cotton production, climate change poses an additional stress and deserves special attention.\nChanges in VWC and water demands for cotton production are of special importance, as cotton production is known for its intense water consumption.\nThe implications of climate impacts on cotton production on the one hand and the impact of cotton production on water resources on the other hand illustrate the need to assess how future climate change may affect cotton production and its resource requirements. Our results should be regarded as optimistic, because of high uncertainty with respect to CO2 fertilization and the lack of implementing processes of boll abscission under heat stress.\nStill, the inclusion of cotton in LPJmL allows for various large-scale studies to assess impacts of climate change on hydrological factors and the implications for agricultural production and carbon sequestration.\n",

      "Challenges and Opportunities Facing Ecotourism in Sub-Saharan Africa from Climate Change Desertification",
    abstract:
      "This study explores one aspect of the macro-atmospheric phenomenon of amplified climate change that is causing significant micro manifestation challenges in one of the most fragile ecosystems on earth, sub-Saharan Africa.  The micro manifestation of desertification impacts humans, flora, and fauna all of whom already struggle to survive in these areas. Desertification in turn effects ecotourism. Desertification is a type of land degradation in which biological productivity is reduced and where fertile areas become arid. Desertification causes the loss of vegetation and food for livestock and humans and a decrease in drinking water reserves. Our examination researches the extents of desertification in the area and the effect it is having on ecotourism.  We explore the strategies for proper ecotourism management and planning that are being utilized to offset these effects and explore how these strategies can and are being utilized to offset these effects and even supply numerous economic resources for government, private sector, and local groups to help improve living conditions and quality of life. Ecotourism in these unique ecosystems that are impacted by climatic changes provide a meaningful opportunity to enhance the lives of host communities and protect the environment.  During a recent visit to Namibia, I found residents who are utilizing innovative strategies such as solar energy, rainwater collection and other innovations to protect the ecosystem, wildlife and environment and allow them to continue to continue to host ecotourists and provide services. Resources for ecotourism in deserts are made of the mutual effect of topography, climate, water, wildlife, plant type and density. Previous studies have shown that if ecotourism is properly managed and planned, it has the potential for numerous economic resources for the local community.  We examine the extent of desertification in these semi-arid deserts, the planning and management of ecotourism activities, and the role that education of these ecosystems could provide for additional economic resources and ecological protection.  ",

      "Effect of climate change on vegetation phenology of different land-cover types on the Tibetan Plateau",
    abstract:
      "ABSTRACT Research in vegetation phenology change has been one heated topic of current ecological and climate change study. The Tibetan Plateau, as the highest plateau of the earth, is more vulnerable and sensitive to climate change than many other regions. In this region, shifts in vegetation phenology have been intensively studied during recent decades, primarily based on satellite-retrieved data. In this study, we explored the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation phenology for different land-cover types in the Tibetan Plateau and characterized their relationship with temperature and precipitation by using long-term time-series datasets of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1982 to 2014. Diverse phenological changes were observed for different land-cover types, with an advancing start of growing season (SOS), delaying end of growing season (EOS) and increasing length of growing season (LOS) in the eastern Tibetan Plateau where meadow was the dominant vegetation type, but with the opposite changes in the steppe and sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub regions which are mostly located in the northwestern and western edges of the Tibetan Plateau. Correlation analysis indicated that sufficient preseason precipitation may delay the SOS of evergreen forests in the southeastern Plateau and advance the SOS of steppe and sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub in relatively arid areas, while the advance of SOS in meadow areas could be related to higher preseason temperature. For EOS, because it is less sensitive to climate change than SOS, the response of EOS for different land-cover types to precipitation and temperature were more complicated across the Tibetan Plateau.",

    abstract:
      "ABSTRACT Drawing on a presentation given at the Geographical Association’s Annual Conference in April 2021 (Williams, 2021a), this article investigates the way that depictions of planet Earth are often simpliﬁed to green continents on blue oceans, accidentally universalising a white and western perspective of the Earth. The article demonstrates how this effect is evident in language too, where commentators or campaigns often use ‘we’ to create a sense of a common human experience. This universalising tendency reinforces existing Eurocentric geographies, obscuring the inequalities of climate change and the fact that some areas of the world are much more vulnerable to it than others. These inequalities fall along racial lines, with people of colour much more likely to be adversely affected by climate change, while majority white countries bear the greatest responsibility for historical emissions. To make the racial dimension of climate change visible, this article argues for a greater focus on the perspectives of people of colour in climate discourse.",

    abstract:
      "The world's forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.",

    title: "Non-Climatic Factors Causing Climate Change",
    abstract:
      "Climate change refers to fluctuations in the global climate of the earth or in regional climates over time. It describes changes in volatility or average weather conditions or average (normal) weather on time scales that fluctuate between decades and millions of years. These changes may be due to internal processes on Earth, or external forces (for example, fluctuations in the intensity of sunlight), or more recently to climate change-related activities. Especially in recent applications, in the field of environmental policy, the term \"climate change\" often refers only to current changes in the new climate. The issue of climate change and its potential effects on various economic and social sectors is one of the challenges of human technology. Recent studies show that emissions from greenhouse gases are a major cause of global warming. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in understanding the Earth's climatic history. According to these studies, the effect of greenhouse gases, which generate heat by trapping heat by greenhouse gases, plays a key role in regulating the earth's temperature. This article examines the non-climatic factors that cause climate change.",

Climate change, which includes increase in temperature, changes in rainfall pattern, sea level rise, salt-water intrusion, generation of floods and droughts is recognized as a global issue (Bates et al., 2008). At present due to anthropogenic activities like industrialization, deforestation and automobiles etc. changes in the climate are being taken place, which will again turn detrimental to life (Rakshit et al., 2009).

    abstract:
      "We analyze the carbon‐climate feedback in eight Earth System Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We focus on tropical land carbon change and find decreases (−31.02 to −169.32 GtC K−1) indicating tropical ecosystems will release carbon as temperature warms, thus contributing to a positive feedback identified in earlier studies. We further investigate the relationship between tropical land carbon change and sensitivity of historical atmospheric CO2 growth rate to tropical temperature variability and find a weak linear relationship. This sensitivity for most models is stronger than observed. We further use this “emergent constraint” to constrain uncertainties in model‐projected future carbon‐climate changes and find little effect in narrowing the model spread, but the mean sensitivity is slightly smaller. This contrasts with earlier Coupled Carbon Cycle Climate Model Intercomparison Project results, highlighting the challenge in constraining future projections by modern observations and the necessity for evaluating such relationships continuously.",

      "Climate Change and the Impact of Greenhouse Gasses: CO2 and NO, Friends and Foes of Plant Oxidative Stress",
    abstract:
      "Here, we review information on how plants face redox imbalance caused by climate change, and focus on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in this response. Life on Earth is possible thanks to greenhouse effect. Without it, temperature on Earth’s surface would be around -19°C, instead of the current average of 14°C. Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG) like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3). GHG have natural and anthropogenic origin. However, increasing GHG provokes extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts and heat, which induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, β-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plants have developed an antioxidant machinery that includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments. CO2 and NO help to maintain the redox equilibrium. Higher CO2 concentrations increase the photosynthesis through the CO2-unsaturated Rubisco activity. But Rubisco photorespiration and NOX activities could also augment ROS production. NO regulate the ROS concentration preserving balance among ROS, GSH, GSNO, and ASC. When ROS are in huge concentration, NO induces transcription and activity of SOD, APX, and CAT. However, when ROS are necessary (e.g., for pathogen resistance), NO may inhibit APX, CAT, and NOX activity by the S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, favoring cell death. NO also regulates GSH concentration in several ways. NO may react with GSH to form GSNO, the NO cell reservoir and main source of S-nitrosylation. GSNO could be decomposed by the GSNO reductase (GSNOR) to GSSG which, in turn, is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSNOR may be also inhibited by S-nitrosylation and GR activated by NO. In conclusion, NO plays a central role in the tolerance of plants to climate change.",

    title: "Humid heat and climate change",
    abstract:
      "Extreme heat events cause significant societal impacts, prompting much concern and research about possible changes to their frequency and intensity as the climate warms. However, to date, extremes in air temperature have been emphasised at the expense of ‘heat-humidity’ indices, measures which incorporate the effect of atmospheric latent heat content on heat stress and provide a more complete picture of the thermal environment for human thermoregulation. This progress report restores balance by reviewing recent developments in the understanding of how heat-humidity indices have changed, and may continue to, as the climate warms further. The literature indicates that a concurrent rise in temperature and absolute humidity has already increased the frequency of potentially deadly conditions, and has reduced labour potential worldwide. More serious consequences may result if mitigation efforts are unsuccessful. The energetic basis of a heat-humidity perspective has permitted researchers to identify, for example, that by the end of the century, substantial parts of the Earth’s surface may be too hot and humid for human thermoregulation. Such consequences are avoided for less pessimistic scenarios of climate warming, but the societal impacts may still be very severe, as densely-populated low-latitude environments emerge as particularly at risk when a humid heat perspective is adopted. Counter to air temperature, changes in mean heat-humidity indices are actually amongst the largest worldwide at lower latitudes, where only small increases in the mean may be required to substantially enhance the frequency of dangerous conditions. The report concludes by outlining areas requiring improved process understanding, and it highlights the urgent role for societal adaptation if the worst impacts from rising humid heat are to be avoided.",

      "AbstractThe effects of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on surface climate using two ensembles of numerical experiments with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) comprehensive Earth System Model ESM2Mb are investigated in this study. The experiments simulate historical climate with two different assumptions about LULCC: 1) no land-use change with potential vegetation (PV) and 2) with the CMIP5 historical reconstruction of LULCC (LU). Two different approaches were used in the analysis: 1) the authors compare differences in LU and PV climates to evaluate the regional and global effects of LULCC and 2) the authors characterize subgrid climate differences among different land-use tiles within each grid cell in the LU experiment. Using the first method, the authors estimate the magnitude of LULCC effect to be similar to some previous studies. Using the second method, the authors found a pronounced subgrid signal of LULCC in near-surface temperature over majority of areas affected by LULCC. Th...",

      "A Physical–Mathematical Approach to Climate Change Effects through Stochastic Resonance",
    abstract:
      "The aim of this work is to study the effects induced by climate changes in the framework of the stochastic resonance approach. First, a wavelet cross-correlation analysis on Earth temperature data concerning the last 5,500,000 years is performed; this analysis confirms a correlation between the planet’s temperature and the 100,000, 41,000, and 23,000-year periods of the Milankovitch orbital cycles. Then, the stochastic resonance model is invoked. Specific attention is given to the study of the impact of the registered global temperature increase within the stochastic model. Further, a numerical simulation has been performed, based on: (1) A double-well potential, (2) an external periodic modulation, corresponding to the orbit eccentricity cycle, and (3) an increased value of the global Earth temperature. The effect of temperature increase represents one of the novelties introduced in the present study and is determined by downshifting the interaction potential used within the stochastic resonance model. The numeric simulation results show that, for simulated increasing values of the global temperature, the double-well system triggers changes, while at higher temperatures (as in the case of the absence of a global temperature increase although with a different threshold) the system goes into a chaotic regime. The wavelet analysis allows characterization of the stochastic resonance condition through the evaluation of the signal-to-noise ratio. On the basis of the obtained findings, we hypothesize that the global temperature increase can suppress, on a large time scale corresponding to glacial cycles, the external periodic modulation effects and, hence, the glacial cycles.",

    title: "Forests , Carbon and Climate Change : the UK Contribution",
    abstract:
      "A discussion of UK forests and carbon-related issues must start with an overview of global climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the so-called ‘greenhouse gases’ which are responsible for absorbing energy from the sun, leading to warming of the earth’s atmosphere – the ‘greenhouse effect’. Many GHGs occur naturally in the atmosphere and their presence is important for ensuring that the global climate is warm enough to support life. In the absence of GHGs, the planet would be 30oC cooler and most life in its present form would not exist. However, there is consensus among scientists that the world’s climate is changing because the concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere are rising. Carbon dioxide is the most important contributor to this enhanced greenhouse effect. During the 1990s, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 increased by about 1.5 parts per million (ppm) per year, continuing an upward trend which has seen a preindustrial concentration of ~_ 280 ppm rise to the current value of ~_ 370 ppm. Underlying this overall increase is a complex pattern of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, the oceans, terrestrial vegetation (including forests) and fossil fuel reserves, summarised in Figure 2 as a simplified global carbon budget.",

    abstract:
      "Changes in rainfall affect drinking water, river and surface runoff, soil moisture, groundwater reserve, electricity generation, agriculture production and ultimately the economy of a country. Trends in rainfall, therefore, are important for examining the impact of climate change on water resources for its planning and management. Here, as analysed from 119 years of rainfall measurements at 16 different rain gauge stations across northeast India, a significant change in the rainfall pattern is evident after the year 1973, with a decreasing trend in rainfall of about 0.42 ± 0.024 mm dec−1. The wettest place of the world has shifted from Cherrapunji (CHE) to Mawsynram (MAW) (separated by 15 km) in recent decades, consistent with long-term rainfall changes in the region. The annual mean accumulated rainfall was about 12 550 mm at MAW and 11 963 mm at CHE for the period 1989–2010, as deduced from the available measurements at MAW. The changes in the Indian Ocean temperature have a profound effect on the rainfall in the region, and the contribution from the Arabian Sea temperature and moisture is remarkable in this respect, as analysed with a multivariate regression procedure for the period 1973–2019. The changes in land cover are another important aspect of this shift in rainfall pattern, as we find a noticeable reduction in vegetation area in northeast India in the past two decades, implying the human influence on recent climate change.",

      "Indices of extremes: geographic patterns of change in extremes and associated vegetation impacts under climate intervention",
    abstract:
      "Abstract. Extreme weather events have been demonstrated to be increasing in frequency\nand intensity across the globe and are anticipated to increase further with\nprojected changes in climate. Solar climate intervention strategies,\nspecifically stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), have the potential to\nminimize some of the impacts of a changing climate while more robust\nreductions in greenhouse gas emissions take effect. However, to date little\nattention has been paid to the possible responses of extreme weather and\nclimate events under climate intervention scenarios. We present an analysis\nof 16 extreme surface temperature and precipitation indices, as well as associated\nvegetation responses, applied to the Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS).\nGLENS is an ensemble of simulations performed with the Community Earth\nSystem Model (CESM1) wherein SAI is simulated to offset the warming produced\nby a high-emission scenario throughout the 21st century, maintaining surface\ntemperatures at 2020 levels. GLENS is generally successful at maintaining global mean temperature near\n2020 levels; however, it does not completely offset some of the projected\nwarming in northern latitudes. Some regions are also projected to cool\nsubstantially in comparison to the present day, with the greatest decreases\nin daytime temperatures. The differential warming–cooling also translates to\nfewer very hot days but more very hot nights during the summer and fewer\nvery cold days or nights compared to the current day. Extreme precipitation\npatterns, for the most part, are projected to reduce in intensity in areas\nthat are wet in the current climate and increase in intensity in dry areas.\nWe also find that the distribution of daily precipitation becomes more\nconsistent with more days with light rain and fewer very intense events\nthan currently occur. In many regions there is a reduction in the\npersistence of long dry and wet spells compared to present day. However,\nasymmetry in the night and day temperatures, together with changes in cloud\ncover and vegetative responses, could exacerbate drying in regions that are\nalready sensitive to drought. Overall, our results suggest that while SAI\nmay ameliorate some of the extreme weather hazards produced by global\nwarming, it would also present some significant differences in the\ndistribution of climate extremes compared to the present day.\n",

    abstract:
      "Environmental pollution states the toxification by different forms of pollutants in the surroundings. This causes the natural system imbalance and affects the life on earth in different ways. The emissions of pollutants into air result in climate changes. The rising levels of CO2 and other air-polluting gases increase the greenhouse effect which results in temperature elevations and affects global weather patterns. Bill Gates also warned “Climate change is a terrible problem, and it absolutely needs to be solved; it deserves to be a huge priority”. Though climate change and air pollution are closely linked, these are treated as separate problems. Hence, it is aimed to understand the aspects of association between climate change and air pollution in this chapter with the objectives: (i) To know the basics of climate change and air pollution, (ii) To review the active background studies on climate change as well as on air pollution, (iii) To identify the issues, controversies, problems which include the effects of global warming and greenhouse gases followed by the types of air pollutants and its harmful effects, (iv) To find the solutions and recommendations, the discussions are made on climate laws and policies, (v) To retrieve, analyze and store the climate change related information, the description about models, tools and databases are given, (vi) To have a flawless insights on the association of climate change and air pollution, (vii) To exemplify species indicators for the assessment of the effect of air pollution on climate change are also included. As Bernie Sanders said “Climate change is a planetary crisis. We've got to act, and we have to act boldly”.",

      "Climate change and the latitudinal selectivity of ancient marine extinctions",
    abstract:
      "Abstract. Geologically rapid climate change is anticipated to increase extinction risk nonuniformly across the Earth's surface. Tropical species may be more vulnerable than temperate species to current climate warming because of high tropical climate velocities and reduced seawater oxygen levels. To test whether rapid warming indeed preferentially increased the extinction risk of tropical fossil taxa, we combine a robust statistical assessment of latitudinal extinction selectivity (LES) with the dominant views on climate change occurring at ancient extinction crises. Using a global data set of marine fossil occurrences, we assess extinction rates for tropical and temperate genera, applying log ratios to assess effect size and Akaike weights for model support. Among the classical “big five” mass extinction episodes, the end-Permian mass extinction exhibits temperate preference of extinctions, whereas the Late Devonian and end-Triassic selectively hit tropical genera. Simple links between the inferred direction of climate change and LES are idiosyncratic, both during crisis and background intervals. More complex models, including sampling patterns and changes in the latitudinal distribution of continental shelf area, show tropical LES to be generally associated with raised tropical heat and temperate LES with global cold temperatures. With implications for the future, our paper demonstrates the consistency of high tropical temperatures, habitat loss, and the capacity of both to interact in generating geographic patterns in extinctions.",

    title: "A Trust Model for Consumer Internet Shopping",
    abstract:
      "E-commerce success, especially in the business-to-consumer area, is determined in part by whether consumers trust sellers and products they cannot see or touch, and electronic systems with which they have no previous experience. This paper describes a theoretical model for investigating the four main antecedent influences on consumer trust in Internet shopping, a major form of business-to-consumer e-commerce: trustworthiness of the Internet merchant, trustworthiness of the Internet as a shopping medium, infrastructural (contextual) factors (e.g., security, third-party certification), and other factors (e.g., company size, demographic variables). The antecedent variables are moderated by the individual consumer's degree of trust propensity, which reflects personality traits, culture, and experience. Based on the research model, a comprehensive set of hypotheses is formulated and a methodology for testing them is outlined. Some of the hypotheses are tested empirically to demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical model. The findings indicate that merchant integrity is a major positive determinant of consumer trust in Internet shopping, and that its effect is moderated by the individual consumer's trust propensity.",

    abstract:
      "Abstract The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides a large suite of online resources for biological information and data, including the GenBank® nucleic acid sequence database and the PubMed database of citations and abstracts for published life science journals. The Entrez system provides search and retrieval operations for most of these data from 39 distinct databases. The E-utilities serve as the programming interface for the Entrez system. Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. New resources released in the past year include PubMed Data Management, RefSeq Functional Elements, genome data download, variation services API, Magic-BLAST, QuickBLASTp, and Identical Protein Groups. Resources that were updated in the past year include the genome data viewer, a human genome resources page, Gene, virus variation, OSIRIS, and PubChem. All of these resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.",

    title: "MICADO: the E-ELT adaptive optics imaging camera",
    abstract:
      "MICADO is the adaptive optics imaging camera for the E-ELT. It has been designed and optimised to be mounted to the LGS-MCAO system MAORY, and will provide diffraction limited imaging over a wide (~1 arcmin) field of view. For initial operations, it can also be used with its own simpler AO module that provides on-axis diffraction limited performance using natural guide stars. We discuss the instrument's key capabilities and expected performance, and show how the science drivers have shaped its design. We outline the technical concept, from the opto-mechanical design to operations and data processing. We describe the AO module, summarise the instrument performance, and indicate some possible future developments.",

      "Origin of the West Nile virus responsible for an outbreak of encephalitis in the northeastern United States.",
    abstract:
      "In late summer 1999, an outbreak of human encephalitis occurred in the northeastern United States that was concurrent with extensive mortality in crows (Corvus species) as well as the deaths of several exotic birds at a zoological park in the same area. Complete genome sequencing of a flavivirus isolated from the brain of a dead Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), together with partial sequence analysis of envelope glycoprotein (E-glycoprotein) genes amplified from several other species including mosquitoes and two fatal human cases, revealed that West Nile (WN) virus circulated in natural transmission cycles and was responsible for the human disease. Antigenic mapping with E-glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies and E-glycoprotein phylogenetic analysis confirmed these viruses as WN. This North American WN virus was most closely related to a WN virus isolated from a dead goose in Israel in 1998.",

      "The miR-200 family determines the epithelial phenotype of cancer cells by targeting the E-cadherin repressors ZEB1 and ZEB2.",
    abstract:
      "Cancer progression has similarities with the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) found during embryonic development, during which cells down-regulate E-cadherin and up-regulate Vimentin expression. By evaluating the expression of 207 microRNAs (miRNAs) in the 60 cell lines of the drug screening panel maintained by the Nation Cancer Institute, we identified the miR-200 miRNA family as an extraordinary marker for cells that express E-cadherin but lack expression of Vimentin. These findings were extended to primary ovarian cancer specimens. miR-200 was found to directly target the mRNA of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (TCF8/deltaEF1) and ZEB2 (SMAD-interacting protein 1 [SIP1]/ZFXH1B). Ectopic expression of miR-200 caused up-regulation of E-cadherin in cancer cell lines and reduced their motility. Conversely, inhibition of miR-200 reduced E-cadherin expression, increased expression of Vimentin, and induced EMT.

    abstract:
      "To combat the threat to human health and biosecurity from antimicrobial resistance, an understanding of its mechanisms and drivers is needed. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms is a natural phenomenon, yet antimicrobial resistance selection has been driven by antimicrobial exposure in health care, agriculture, and the environment. Onward transmission is aff ected by standards of infection control, sanitation, access to clean water, access to assured quality antimicrobials and diagnostics, travel, and migration. Strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance by removing antimicrobial selective pressure alone rely upon resistance imparting a fi tness cost, an eff ect not always apparent. Minimising resistance should therefore be considered comprehensively, by resistance mechanism, microorganism, antimicrobial drug, host, and context; parallel to new drug discovery, broad ranging, multidisciplinary research is needed across these fi ve levels, interlinked across the health-care, agriculture, and environment sectors. Intelligent, integrated approaches, mindful of potential unintended results, are needed to ensure sustained, worldwide access to eff ective antimicrobials.",

      "Limits on Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers from the Most Negative χ eff Systems",
    abstract:
      "It has been proposed that some black holes (BHs) in binary black hole (BBH) systems are born from “hierarchical mergers” (HMs), i.e., earlier mergers of smaller BHs. These HM products have spin magnitudes χ ∼ 0.7, and, if they are dynamically assembled into BBH systems, their spin orientations will sometimes be antialigned with the binary orbital angular momentum. In fact, as Baibhav et al. showed, ∼16% of BBH systems that include HM products will have an effective inspiral spin parameter, χ eff < −0.3. Nevertheless, the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors have yet to observe a BBH system with χ eff ≲ −0.2, leading to upper limits on the fraction of HM products in the population. We fit the astrophysical mass and spin distribution of BBH systems and measure the fraction of BBH systems with χ eff < −0.3, which implies an upper limit on the HM fraction. We find that fewer than 26% of systems in the underlying BBH population include HM products (90% credibility). Even among BBH systems with primary masses m 1 = 60 M ⊙, the HM fraction is less than 69%, which may constrain the location of the pair-instability mass gap. With 300 GW events (to be expected in the LVK’s next observing run), if we fail to observe a BBH with χ eff < −0.3, we can conclude that the HM fraction is smaller than 2.5−2.2+9.1% .",

    abstract:
      "Since the last few decades, the number of road causalities has seen continuous growth across the globe. Nowa-days intelligent transportation systems are being developed to enable safe and relaxed driving and scene understanding of the surrounding environment is an integral part of it. While several approaches are being developed for semantic scene segmentation based on deep learning and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), these approaches assume well structured road infrastructure and driving environment. We focus our work on recent India Driving Lite Dataset (IDD), which contains data from unstructured driving environment and was hosted as an online challenge in NCVPRIPG 2019. We propose a novel architecture named as Eff-UNet which combines the effectiveness of compound scaled EfficientNet as the encoder for feature extraction with UNet decoder for reconstructing the fine-grained segmentation map. High level feature information as well as low level spatial information useful for precise segmentation are combined. The proposed architecture achieved 0.7376 and 0.6276 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on validation and test dataset respectively and won first prize in IDD lite segmentation challenge outperforming other approaches in the literature.",

    abstract:
      "Recent years have seen substantial improvements in life expectancy and access to antimicrobials, especially in lowincome and lower-middle-income countries, but increasing pathogen resistance to antimicrobials threatens to roll back this progress. Resistant organisms in health-care and community settings pose a threat to survival rates from serious infections, including neonatal sepsis and health-care-associated infections, and limit the potential health benefi ts from surgeries, transplants, and cancer treatment. The challenge of simultaneously expanding appropriate access to antimicrobials, while restricting inappropriate access, particularly to expensive, newer generation antimicrobials, is unique in global health and requires new approaches to fi nancing and delivering health care and a one-health perspective on the connections between pathogen transmission in animals and humans. Here, we describe the importance of eff ective antimicrobials. We assess the disease burden caused by limited access to antimicrobials, attributable to resistance to antimicrobials, and the potential eff ect of vaccines in restricting the need for antibiotics.",

    abstract:
      "We present in this work a new calculation of the standard-model benchmark value for the effective number of neutrinos, $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm SM}$, that quantifies the cosmological neutrino-to-photon energy densities. The calculation takes into account neutrino flavour oscillations, finite-temperature effects in the quantum electrodynamics plasma to ${\\cal O}(e^3)$, where $e$ is the elementary electric charge, and a full evaluation of the neutrino--neutrino collision integral. We provide furthermore a detailed assessment of the uncertainties in the benchmark $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm SM}$ value, through testing the value's dependence on (i) optional approximate modelling of the weak collision integrals, (ii) measurement errors in the physical parameters of the weak sector, and (iii) numerical convergence, particularly in relation to momentum discretisation. Our new, recommended standard-model benchmark is $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm SM} = 3.0433 \\pm 0.0002$, where the nominal uncertainty is attributed predominantly to errors incurred in the numerical solution procedure, augmented by measurement errors in the solar mixing angle $\\sin^2\\theta_{12}$.",
